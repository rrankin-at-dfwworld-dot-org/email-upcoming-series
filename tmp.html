        <p>Ebola - one word, one threat uniting nations.</p>

        <p>The Commissioner of Health for the Nigerian state of Lagos, Dr. Olajide Idris, is a physician with
        experience in both a nation that faced Africa's ebola storm and a nation that was surprised by the fever's
        arrival.</p>

        <p>It is the winning battle against ebola that has been the focus of his nation. And as news reports
        emphasized, ebola became a stunning challenge to residents and health care professionals in Dallas and the
        United States.</p>

        <p>Dr. Idris, critically involved in the Lagos procedures, is familiar with the ways government and medicine
        mesh in the United States. After becoming a physician in Nigeria, Dr. Idris earned a Master's Degree in Public
        Health at Yale University. In the mid-'90s, Dr. Idris continued his medical studies working in emergency
        medicine and cardiology at stateside schools and hospitals in the United States.</p>

        <p>Nigeria has been ebola-free since August 31 after being struck in July when a Liberian-born American came to
        Lagos after spending time in Liberia. Through swift action, strict quarantine measures and screening of victim
        contacts, Nigeria managed to stop the virus.</p>

        <p>More than 8,200 people have died from ebola and more than 20,700 have fallen ill in the latest outbreak that
        touched the nations of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria.</p>
