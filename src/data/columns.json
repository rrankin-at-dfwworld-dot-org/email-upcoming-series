      "Respected Kirkus Reviews describes the book as \"a catalog of occasional victories and constant missteps that is eye-opening, illuminating and maddening.\"",
      "Subtitled \"A CIA Diary,\" the book provides a platform for Grenier to cite the names of supporters and detractors while outlining the many challenges to his strategy. He planned a way to unite supporters in Afghanistan to achieve what was planned to be \"final defeat of the Taliban\" while allowing future Afghan President Hamid Karzai to rise to power in \"88 chaotic days.\"",

      "Grenier is frequently sought by media to comment on matters involving counterterrorism, CIA interrogation policies and current events."
